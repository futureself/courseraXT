courseraXT
==========

A set of scripts to extend the functionality of coursera.org

So far it **counts section minutes so you don't have to**. Every week I found myself counting lecture minutes so that I could plan my schedule ahead of time, so I ended up writing a small browser extension to do just that. Not extensively tested, but it has worked well for me in the courses I've taken so far.

This version is bundled as a Chrome extension, and it can be installed following these steps:

1. Type **chrome://extensions** in your browser
2. Activate the **'Developer mode'** checkbox
3. Click **'Load unpacked extension'** and select the courseraXT directory.

After reloading the lectures section of a course the minute count per section should be displayed on the right side of each section title.
