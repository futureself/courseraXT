courseraXT
==========

A set of scripts to extend the functionality of coursera.org

So far it does the small job of counting section minutes so you don't have to.

This version is bundled as a Chrome extension, and it can be installed following these steps:
1. Type chrome://extensions in your browser
2. Activate the 'Developer mode' checkbox
3. Click 'Load unpacked extension' and select the courseraXT directory.

After reloading the lectures section of a course the minute count per section should be displayed on the right side of each section title.
