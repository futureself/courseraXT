courseraXT
==========

A set of scripts to extend the functionality of **[coursera.org](https://www.coursera.org)**

#### minutes.js
**It counts section minutes so you don't have to**. When this script is enabled the minute count per section is displayed next to each section title.

#### step-rewind.js
**Allows step rewinds of 15 seconds**. This extra control to the coursera video player may be useful if your attention diverges from the lecture at some point, or if you are working through a fast-paced content-rich course.
